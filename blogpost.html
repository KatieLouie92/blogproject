     <h2>Introduction</h2>

     <p class="borderparagraph">Hi, welcome back to my channel, oh wait, I mean blog. Am I the only person that dislikes when "youtubers" use that as their intro in their videos? At least Jeffree Star makes it memorable with a star mirror and some affects; Jackie Aina has a cool lil "jackie jackie jackie" beat/song she does (Can you tell I watch make-up videos?)
         Anyhoo, I wanted to introduce my self to you, my family calls me Katie and you can too. I like making blog sites, yoga with adrienne, interior design, and of course, <strong><em>Plus Size Fashion</em></strong>.</p>
     
    <div>
        <p>I've grown up as a <em>beautiful</em> plus-zize person, that I love, but I know my current lifestyle isn't <em>100%</em> where I want to be so I'm currently making healthier life choices. I'll be honest, I don't think that it's a journey that is an easy one. When you're young, you're taught being "larger" or "plus sized" is not lovable. Especially, growing up as a plus-sized teen when I did, if you didn't fit in the teen section you had to shop the womens clothes. Which,
        for my teenage taste, was like a fashion no-no.</p>
        <p class="bottomp"><em>Flash-forward</em> to the world we live in now! Plus sized women are models, diversity is not only "in" but we connect emotionally with seeing people of different sizes and skin tones. Thanks to social media, it's easier than ever to find people to look up to and follow their journey to inspire others like them. I wanted to create my blog not only to (hopefully) 
        do the same but to diary my experience as a plus-size person in this fashion world and my life.</p>

    <h2>Why Can't I Wear Dresses Everyday?</h2>

    <p class="borderparagraph"> 
        Don't let anyone tell you can't wear a dress everyday. Maybe this is more of a <em>'preach of the day' for myself</em>. They're the first thing I check out when I shop, and now almost all of them come with pockets! Truthfully, I love them because it's a way to wear a whole outfit without wearing a whole outfit, if you know what I mean.</p>
    <div>
        <p>Now that summer is basically over here in Seattle, it's the time to incorporate our dresses we wore in the summer into winter. Jackets, tee's or sweaters over and under our dresses, boots, and so much more! I've <em>pictured</em> my favorite dresses down below that I wear all year long that I change from summer to fall.</p>

        <p>A lil info about these guys!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first one, I've gotten from Soncy Shop, which is an online retailer that specializes in plus size clothing. Some of their things i've gotten is very mixed bag, either it's awesome or whatever quality. They're also not super inexpensive so that's kind of disappointing for the price you're paying, however there are free returns. Pale pink is one of my favorite colors, I just paired this with a floral top underneath and some super cool velvet rust booties!</li>
                <li>Another Dress from Soncy, (I won a gift card from them via Instagram which was cool, so I got to try a lot of their stuff) this black sating button up is so comfy! Super easy to dress up or down, I just paired with a black denim jacked and once again, my favorite velvet rust booties. </li>
                <li>Last is a dress from Asos. It's kind of hard to tell in the photo becuase of the editing, but it's a super cute, dark teal corduroy dress, I just paired it with a complimentary color of this cute orange sweater that has balloon sleeves.</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="bottomp">You'll probably see a lot of Asos on my page, it's one of the more affordable plus size online stores i've found. I've been pretty curious about Eloquii and Madewell to see how they're sizing would work on my body shape. I'm pretty top heavy, which can make finding clothes harder because of the large breasticles. I challenge you to try one day this week (or shoot! many days!) to <em>"fall up"</em> your dress!
